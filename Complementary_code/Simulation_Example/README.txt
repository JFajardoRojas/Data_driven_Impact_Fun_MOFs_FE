### Simulation Guide

1. Run the lammps input file in.FL_path 	| This generates the required outputs.

2. Run the python code FL_path_FE.py with temperature as first argument, and the volume in Ã…^3 as the second argument. 
The volume is obtained in one of the outputs in the previous step.
Example:
	python FL_path_FE.py 300.0 `cat volume.dat`

Using the bash python.sl, the rest of the arguments are hardcoded.

3. The output FL_FE.txt should be: Small differences can occurred due to differences in seed numbers.

### Lammps extra requirements
Lammps built with module USER-MISC
This is required for UFF4MOF Fourier angle terms, and ti/spring fix.

### Python requirements
As stated in the SI.
